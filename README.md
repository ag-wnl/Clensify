##  Overview

The package intends to help developers introduce text-based moderation in their web platform by flagging text content which contains profanity/obscene words and phrases. 

---

##  Features

Clensify does extensive pre-processing to help detect text formats which intend to bypass conventional bad-word filters (zalgo, bubble-text, leetspeak etc.). 

Various detection strategies are used, inlcuding bloom-filtering, others currently in development...
